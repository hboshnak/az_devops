## Repo for very simple DevOps experiments using:

    - Azure Cloud
    - Github Actions
    - Python
    - WSL2

## Main topics that are demonstrated are:

    - Creating Python CLI app with Click
    - Create a Makefile for Python performing:
        - install
        - lint
        - test
    - Setup a GitHub Actions workflow for quality assesment on push or request

## This line was edited in Azure Cloud Shell
I've used Azure Cloud Shell to work and commit here initially.

## But this line is edited from WSL2
I feel that my own system is the way to go and proceeded with WSL2 in some point.
